A list of everything I've ever written that's beyond tech demo level
---

- [nix-tmodloader](https://github.com/andOrlando/nix-tmodloader) my first nix package! tmodloader module for nix with flake support, very easy to use!
- [save-manager](https://github.com/andOrlando/save-manager) incredibly useful git-esque save-manager for games (or really anything)
- [spellingtiff](https://github.com/andOrlando/spellingtiff) clones of the NYT crossword (currently broken?) and spelling bee
- [andorlando.github.io](https://github.com/andOrlando/andorlando.github.io) [real link](https://andorlando.github.io) my personal website, has some interesting ui decisions
- [homework-scripts](https://github.com/andOrlando/homework-scripts) a collection of homework scripts that's really just a bunch of web-automation in vanilla js
- [nix-dotfiles](https://github.com/andOrlando/nix-dotfiles) has my new awesomeWM config, is all nix-based, and is what I use today
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/andOrlando/dotfiles) has my old awesomeWM config
- [awesome-widgets](https://github.com/andOrlando/awesome-widgets) not really a library, but a collection of really well animated awesomeWM widgets I made
- [color](https://github.com/andOrlando/color) second of two awesomeWM libraries, has a very easy to use API for color conversion
- [rubato](https://github.com/andOrlando/rubato) first of two awesomeWM libraries, does kinematics-based animation (and I'm very proud of it)

Research I've contributed to
---

- [RightTyper](https://github.com/RightTyper/RightTyper) with Programming Languages And Systems at Amherst (PLASMA). I contributed to restructuring of sampling (moving away from an accumulation-based model to keeping track of each individual function call), contributed to generic handling (specifically testing and the actual code-generation and dataflow changes needed to accomedate it) and made the interrupt system compatible with Windows.
- [MAGI](https://github.com/cics-syslab/MAGI) with UMass Amherst's Syslab, does autograder generation. I extended it from just C to also typescript and javascript so it could be used in classes other than just CS230

Code I've collaborated with others on
---

- **with my hackathon friends**
  - [eRPC](https://github.com/PianoPanda/HackUMASSXII) new remote protocol framework, way easier to use than gRPC, I may continue working on this later
  - [bad apple in google calendar](https://github.com/PianoPanda/2024_HackHer413) [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6NUBAzFOSc) bad apple but it's made in google calendar, pretty self-explanatory.
  - [RISC-V.js](https://github.com/PianoPanda/HackUMASSXI) a (almost) fully featured RISC-V emulator written in javascript so you can run binaries in the browser

- **[with felix](https://github.com/bennett-felix-software)**
  - [bfbbfb](https://github.com/bennett-felix-software/bfbbfb) BrainFrick compiler and interpreter (and more stuff), written in BrainFrick compiled from a custom DSL written in python. Basically just bootstrapped BrainFrick. Also includes a helpful CLI!
  - [solitaire cipher golf](https://github.com/bennett-felix-software/Pontifex) a really really short implementation of solitaire cipher
  - [nim](https://github.com/bennett-felix-software/nim) a tui-esque web-based 2-player (or pve) game

- **with school clubs**
  - [IUCG Insights](https://github.com/build-umass/iucg-insights) a blog app for Isenberg Undergraduate Consulting Group written with BUILD UMass. I wrote a lot of it
  - [aspine](https://github.com/Aspine/aspine) a frontend for Aspen, my highschool's grade portal. I wrote a lot of UI code for it.
